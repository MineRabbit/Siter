Siter is an online plateform to sell chairs
Anyone can post their offer with the chair details (name, price, number of wheels, has a backrest)
Once the form with all the details is completed the chair is automatically added to the database as well
as the seller (if there's not already another entry with the same name and shop address)
Then there's a catalogue with all the available chairs for customers to pick their favourite and buy it 
(buying a chair removes it from the database)

Limitations :

- Very niche market
- If a lot of sellers are creating new entries it will be hard to choose from the catalogue
- There are no pictures of the chairs

Possible extensions :

- Adding pictures with the chairs
- Having a research feature to make the catalogue less confusing
